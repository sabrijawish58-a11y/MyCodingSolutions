# 🔢 Count Number Frequency in Array

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads an array of integers from the user.
2. Asks for a number to check.
3. Prints how many times that number appears in the array.

### 🔍 Example
Input:
Enter number of elements: 5 
Elements: 7 3 7 2 7 
Number to check: 7
Output:
Original array: 7 3 7 2 7 
Number 7 is repeated 3 time(s).

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadArray()` to read array elements and store length.
- Use `PrintArray()` to display the array.
- Use `TimeRepeated(Number, arr, arrLength)` to count how many times the number appears.
- Use `ReadPositiveNumber()` to validate the number to check.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Array input and traversal
- Frequency counting using loop
- Input validation using `do-while`
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
