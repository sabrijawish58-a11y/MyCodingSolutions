# 🧾 Full Name Formatter

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their first and last name, then prints the full name. The program should support printing the name in normal or reversed order.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use a `struct stInfo` to store `FirstName` and `LastName`.
- Use `ReadInfo()` to collect user input.
- Use `GetFullName()` to format the name based on a `Reversed` flag.
- Use `PrintFullName()` to display the result.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- `struct` for structured input
- String concatenation
- Boolean flag to control output format
- Modular design using functions
