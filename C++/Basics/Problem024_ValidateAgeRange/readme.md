# 🎯 Validate Age Range

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their age and checks whether it falls within the valid range of 18 to 45. Print a message indicating whether the age is valid or invalid.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadAge()` to read the user's age.
- Use `ValidateNumberInRange()` to check if the age is between 18 and 45.
- Use `PrintResult()` to display the appropriate message.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Input validation using range checks
- Conditional logic with `if`
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
