# 🧮 Rectangle Area Calculator

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle, then calculates and prints its area.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read two floating-point values: width and length.
- Use `CalculateRectangleArea()` to compute the area using the formula:  
  `Area = Width × Length`
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the result.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Reference parameters (`float&`) for input
- Basic geometry formula for area
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
