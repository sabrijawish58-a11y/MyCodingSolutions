# 📊 Average of Three Marks

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter three marks, calculates their average, and prints the result.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read three integer marks using reference parameters.
- Use `SumOf3Marks()` to compute the total.
- Use `CalculateAverage()` to divide the sum by 3 and return a float.
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the average.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Reference parameters (`int&`) for direct input
- Arithmetic operations (sum and division)
- Type casting to `float` for accurate average
- Modular design using functions
