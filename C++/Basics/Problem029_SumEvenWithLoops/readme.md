# 🔢 Sum of Even Numbers Using Loops

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter a number, then calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to that number using:
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumber()` to get the upper limit.
- Use `CheckOddOrEvenOrALl()` with an `enum` to classify numbers.
- Use three separate functions to calculate the sum of even numbers using different loop types:
  - `SumEvenFrom1toNum_UsingFor()`
  - `SumEvenFrom1toNum_UsingWhile()`
  - `SumEvenFrom1toNum_UsingDoWhile()`

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Looping constructs: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Conditional logic with `if` and `enum`
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
