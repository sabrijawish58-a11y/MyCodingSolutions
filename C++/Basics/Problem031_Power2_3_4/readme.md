# 🔢 Powers of 2, 3, and 4

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints:
- The square of the number (power of 2)
- The cube of the number (power of 3)
- The fourth power of the number (power of 4)

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumber()` to get the input from the user.
- Use `PowerOf2_3_4()` to calculate and print the powers using repeated multiplication.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Arithmetic operations (multiplication)
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
