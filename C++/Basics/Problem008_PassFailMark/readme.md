# 🎓 Pass or Fail Checker

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their mark and prints whether they passed or failed. A mark of 50 or more is considered a pass.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadMark()` to get the user's mark.
- Use `CheckMark()` to determine if the mark is ≥ 50.
- Use an `enum enPassFail` to represent the result.
- Use `PrintResults()` to display "You Passed" or "You Failed".

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- `enum` for semantic clarity
- Conditional logic with `if`
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
