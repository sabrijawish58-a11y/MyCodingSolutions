# 💸 Monthly Installment Calculator

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter:
- The total loan amount
- The number of months to repay the loan  
Then calculates and prints the monthly installment.

## 💡 Solution Summary

- Use `MonthlyInstallment()` to compute:
  `MonthlyInstallment = LoanAmount / NumberOfMonths`
- Print the result in `main()`.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Input validation using `do-while`
- Basic division for installment calculation
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions

## 📦 Folder Contents
- `main.cpp`: Contains the full solution with input, calculation, and output
