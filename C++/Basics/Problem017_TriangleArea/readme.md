# 🔺 Triangle Area Calculator

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter the base and height of a triangle, then calculates and prints its area.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read two floating-point values: base `A` and height `H`.
- Use `TriangleArea()` to compute the area using the formula:  
  `Area = (A / 2) × H`
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the result.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Basic geometry formula for triangle area
- Reference parameters (`float&`) for input
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
