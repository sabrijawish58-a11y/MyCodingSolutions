# 🔄 Swap Two Numbers

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter two numbers, prints them, swaps their values, and prints them again.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read two integers using reference parameters.
- Use `Swap()` to exchange the values using a temporary variable.
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the numbers before and after swapping.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Reference parameters (`int&`) for direct manipulation
- Variable swapping using a temporary variable
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
