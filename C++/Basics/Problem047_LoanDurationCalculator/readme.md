# 💳 Loan Duration Calculator

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter:
- The total loan amount
- The monthly installment amount  
Then calculates and prints the number of months required to pay off the loan.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadPositiveNumber()` to validate both inputs.
- Use `TotalMonths()` to compute:
  `TotalMonths = LoanAmount / MonthlyInstallment`
- Print the result in `main()`.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Input validation using `do-while`
- Basic division for duration calculation
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions

## 📦 Folder Contents
- `main.cpp`: Contains the full solution with input, calculation, and output
