# 🌀 Print Fibonacci Sequence Using Loop

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that:
1. Prints the first `N` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a loop.
2. Starts the sequence with `1`, and continues by summing the previous two numbers.

### 🔍 Example Output
nput: 10

Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `PrintFibonacciUsingLoop(Number)` to:
  - Initialize `Prev1 = 1`, `Prev2 = 0`
  - Print the first value manually
  - Use a loop from `2` to `Number`
  - Calculate `FebNumber = Prev1 + Prev2`
  - Print and update previous values accordingly

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
