# ➕ Sum of Three Numbers

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter three numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the result.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read three integers from the user using reference parameters.
- Use `SumOf3Numbers()` to compute the total.
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the sum.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Reference parameters (`int &`) for direct input
- Basic arithmetic (addition)
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions

## 📦 Folder Contents
- `main.cpp`: Contains the full solution with input, processing, and output
