# 📐 Rectangle Area Using Side and Diagonal

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter one side of a rectangle and its diagonal, then calculates and prints the area using the Pythagorean theorem.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumbers()` to read side `A` and diagonal `D`.
- Use the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem:  
  `Area = A × √(D² − A²)`
- Use `RectangleAreaBySideAndDiagonal()` to compute the area.
- Use `PrintResults()` to display the result.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Geometry: Pythagorean theorem
- Math functions: `sqrt()` and `pow()`
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
