# 🧑‍💻 Read and Print Name

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their name and prints it on the screen.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Define a function `ReadName()` that uses `getline()` to read a full name from the user.
- Define a function `PrintName(string)` to display the name.
- Call both functions in `main()` to complete the task.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- `#include <iostream>` for input/output
- `#include <string>` for handling strings
- `getline(cin, Name)` to read full names with spaces
- Modular design using functions
