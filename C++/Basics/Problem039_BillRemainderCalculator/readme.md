# 💰 Bill Remainder Calculator

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter the total bill and the total cash paid, then calculates and prints the remainder (change).

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadPositiveNumber()` to ensure both inputs are positive.
- Use `CalculatRemainder()` to compute the difference:  
  `Remainder = TotalCashPaid − TotalBill`
- Use `PrintRemainder()` to display the full transaction details.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Input validation using `do-while`
- Basic arithmetic subtraction
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
