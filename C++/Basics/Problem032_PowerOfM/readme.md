# 🔢 Power of a Number (M)

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter a number and a power, then calculates and prints the result of raising the number to that power.

## 💡 Solution Summary
- Use `ReadNumber()` to get the base number.
- Use `ReadPower()` to get the exponent.
- Use `PowerOfM()` to calculate the result using a loop:
  `Result = Number^M`
- Print the result in `main()`.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Exponentiation using repeated multiplication
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Modular design using functions
- Defensive logic for edge case `M == 1`
