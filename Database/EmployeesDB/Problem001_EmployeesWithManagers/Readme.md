# Problem 001 â€“ Employees with Their Managers

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Retrieve all employees who have a **manager**, and display:
- Employee's `Name`
- `ManagerID`
- `Salary`
- Manager's `Name` (as `ManagerName`)

This query uses a **self-join** to relate each employee to their manager within the same table.

## ðŸ“Š Tables Used

- `Employees`: Contains employee records including `EmployeeID`, `Name`, `ManagerID`, and `Salary`

## ðŸ”— Query Logic

- Perform an `INNER JOIN` between `Employees` and itself (aliased as `Managers`)
- Join condition: `Employees.ManagerID = Managers.EmployeeID`
- Select relevant fields including the manager's name

## ðŸ§¾ SQL Query

```sql
SELECT Employees.Name,
       Employees.ManagerID,
       Employees.Salary,
       Managers.Name AS ManagerName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Employees AS Managers
    ON Employees.ManagerID = Managers.EmployeeID;
