# Problem 046 â€“ Display Fuel Types in Random Order

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Retrieve all records from the `FuelTypes` table and display them in a **random order** each time the query is executed. This is useful for testing UI randomness or rotating display logic.

## ðŸ“Š Tables Used

- `FuelTypes`: Contains fuel type records

## ðŸ”— Query Logic

- Use `ORDER BY NEWID()` to shuffle the result set
- `NEWID()` generates a unique GUID for each row, which SQL Server uses to randomize order

## ðŸ§¾ SQL Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FuelTypes
ORDER BY NEWID();
