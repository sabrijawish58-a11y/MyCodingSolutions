# Problem 033 â€“ Count of Vehicles with Engine Capacity Above Average

## ðŸ§  Problem Description

Calculate the total number of vehicles where the **engine capacity (`Engine_CC`)** is **greater than the average** engine capacity across all vehicles. This query helps quantify how many vehicles are above the performance baseline.

## ðŸ“Š Tables Used

- `VehicleDetails`: Contains vehicle records including `Engine_CC`

## ðŸ”— Query Logic

- Use a subquery to calculate the average `Engine_CC`
- Filter records where `Engine_CC > AVG(Engine_CC)`
- Count the number of matching records

## ðŸ§¾ SQL Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfVehiclesAboveAverageEngineCC
FROM VehicleDetails
WHERE Engine_CC > (
    SELECT AVG(Engine_CC)
    FROM VehicleDetails
);
